# Query Performance

## Process

Explored how the database system optimizes query execution and how users can further tune the performance of their queries.

This project works with the Lahman's Baseball Database, an open source collection of baseball statistics from 1871 to 2020. It contains a variety of data, like batting statistics, team stats, managerial records, Hall of Fame records, and much more.

For various SQL Operations,
I inspected the query plan mainly using the command:
```bash 
%SQL Explain Analyze {Query}
```
Examined the effects of views, predicate pushdowns, joins, and index managements on optimization and tuning for SQL Queries.
